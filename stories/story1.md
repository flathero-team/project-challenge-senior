As a employee of a property rental company, I want to manually store data about applicants for the properties I'm responsible for in my wohungshelden software, so that I also have the data from incoming calls in the system.

The data, I care about is:

- email address
- saluation (optional)
- firstname & lastname
- comment about the user (optional)
